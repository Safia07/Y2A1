        <p>
            Before starting the website, I wanted to choose the colour scheme as it will help determine the outcome 
            of the website. To do this, I researched the colour schemes in websites. What I found out to stick to 
            three colours, one primary colour and two secondary colours. The website that I learned this from is 
            <a href="https://websitesetup.org/website-color-schemes/">here.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            I had also used a colour generator to help choose the colours that I will use on my website using the 
            ‘Coolers’ website. The colour palette that the generator gave me is 
            <a href="https://coolors.co/cdf7f6-8fb8de-9a94bc-9b5094-6a605c">here.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          The first thing that I had to do was to make all the webpages the same, to do this I had created the five 
          webpages. In the style.css file, I had written the code for the background and the text. 
        </p>

        <p>
            One problem that occurred was the github and linked in images in the index webpage were on different lines 
            however, I wanted them on the same line, standing next to each other. Originally, I had written the code 
            in the index html file, however, I realised that I should write the code for the columns in the css. This 
            had solved the problem of the icons in different lines. 
        </p>

        <p> 
          Another problem that had occurred was the texts that said 'Place Holder' and then the number of which the 
          placeholder was for, was on the left of the screen when I had wanted the writing to be under the appropriate 
          icon. The screenshot below shows the problem: 
          <br>
          <img src="./Photos/Capture1.PNG" alt="Portfolio Place Holder text problem" height="50%" width="50%">
          <br>
          Here is the webpage when the problem was fixed.
