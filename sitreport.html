            Before starting the website, I wanted to choose the colour scheme as it will help determine the outcome 
            of the website. To do this, I researched the colour schemes in websites. What I found out to stick to 
            three colours, one primary colour and two secondary colours. The website that I learned this from is 
            <a href="https://websitesetup.org/website-color-schemes/">here</a>
        </p>

            I had also used a colour generator to help choose the colours that I will use on my website using the 
            ‘Coolers’ website. The colour palette that the generator gave me is 
            <a href="https://coolors.co/cdf7f6-8fb8de-9a94bc-9b5094-6a605c">here</a>
